# Words


This is quite straightforward MVVM app where you can store words with any description of them. The main idea of this app is to synchronize your info between Firebase Firestore and Room Database. You can use it whether the network available or not. Authorization is managing with Google API. 

##### You can see an example of syncing below:

### Libraries
There is a list of used libraries: 
- Room Database 
- Navigation
- Lifecycle
- Kotlin Coroutines
- Kodein
- Preferences
- Material Design
- Firebase

When you are on the way of exploring these implementations, there is a sample with them. I tried to do it as simple as it possible. 
So I'd really appreciate your feedback about any significant bug.

# Good luck :)
